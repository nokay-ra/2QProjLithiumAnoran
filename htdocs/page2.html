				<h2> Social Networking:</h2>
				<p>Social Media Websites are tools to connect with people, no matter the distance. This is especially helpful during our current times 
				where it’s recommended that we distance ourselves from each other to flatten the curve. </p>
				<p>stuff about video</p>
				video
				<p>So what websites or apps should you use to connect with your family, friends, and maybe even random people online? Well that depends on 
				what platform they use! Here are a few popular ones:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li><h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" class="h3">Facebook</a></h3> - It was founded in 2004 and has its Headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 
					USA. You’ll need to sign up for it using your email address though, for free, before you can use its website or app.</li>
					<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/" class="h3">Youtube</a></h3> - Youtube was founded in 2005, and its current Headquarters is in San Bruno, 
					California, USA. If you already have a google account, you can sign into Youtube using the same account, or if not you can still access 
					and watch videos, though you can’t comment, like or dislike, subscribe to channels, or make playlists.</li>
					<li><h3><a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" class="h3">WhatsApp</a></h3> - Facebook-owned, WhatsApp is a messaging app. Voice calls, video calls, 
					voice messages, and text messages are free to do on this platform. Users can only do these actions with other users of the platform though.					
					It was founded in 2009 and its headquarters is in Mountain View, California, USA.</li>
					<li><h3><a href="https://www.messenger.com/" class="h3">Facebook Messenger<a></h3> - Messenger, which used to be Facebook Chat, is another 
					Facebook-owned messaging app. Users can send messages, videos, pictures, and files in general using the app, though not for free. 
					Additionally, Messenger Rooms allows for video calls with up to 50 participants. It was founded in 2011 and has its headquarters in Menlo 
					Park, California, USA.</li>
					<li><h3><a href="https://www.instagram.com/" class="h3">Instagram<a></h3> - Instagram is a social media platform for sharing of pictures and videos. 
					It was founded in 2010 and has its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, USA.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2> Time Management:</h2>
				<p>You will most likely be the only one who will be supervising what you do, so it can be hard to stay on schedule. For problems like this, 
				I’ve found a few apps, websites, and some extensions you can use! I’ve read the fine print of each, looked at reviews, and used some 
				personally, so I can say that these can all be trusted.</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li><h3><a href="https://track.toggl.com" class="h3">Toggl Track</a> (Website, Application, Extension)</h3></li>
					<ol>
						<li><a href="https://track.toggl.com">Toggl</a> allows you to record your projects, and see how long it takes you to finish each! This 
						allows you to keep track of not only the amount of time you spend on one project, but multiple projects. Knowing what is dragging you 
						down will allow you to optimize your schedule. However, Toggl depends on you starting the timers, naming the projects, and such, so to 
						really get the pros of it, you’ll have to use it for some time. It also has a great and pretty intuitive layout.</li>
						<li>Features: Alarms, Reminders, Project Timers, Team Making, Separate Workspaces, Connect to GCalendar/Outlook, and more!</li>
						<li>Requirements: E-mail; You can use it for free, or sign up for a Starter promo</li>
						<li>Website: <a href="https://track.toggl.com">track.toggl.com</a> <br>
							Application: Windows/MacOS - <a href="https://toggl.com/track/toggl-desktop/">toggl.com/track/toggl-desktop/</a> <br>
							Android/iOS - <a href="https://toggl.com/track/mobile-time-tracking-app/">toggl.com/track/mobile-time-tracking-app/</a> <br>
							Extension: <a href="https://toggl.com/track/integrations/">toggl.com/track/integrations/</a></li>
						<li>If you ever need extra help, there are articles made by the Toggl Track Team at their 
						<a href="https://support.toggl.com/">Support Page</a></li>
					</ol>
					
					<li><h3><a href="https://trello.com/home" class="h3">Trello</a> (Website & Application)</h3></li>
					<ol>
						<li><a href="https://trello.com/home">Trello</a> allows you to organize your thoughts, projects, and whatever else you want to write 
						down! If you have a group or team to work with, you can also share your workspace with them and they can also add “cards” onto your 
						board. “Cards” are more than just notes though, as you can open these to reveal due dates, checklists, and so much more! With Trello, 
						you can just write a quick card if you need to before you write about it in-depth. You can automate list making, due dates, and a 
						lot more using Butler, their own automation bot.</li>
						<li>Features: Reminders, Team Making, Separate Boards, “Powerups” (limited for non-business users), Customizable and in-depth cards, 
						and more!</li>
						<li>Requirements: E-mail; You can use it for free, or if you want other extra features you can sign up for other promos.</li>
						<li>Website: <a href="https://trello.com/home">trello.com/home</a> <br>
							Applications: <a href="https://trello.com/platforms">trello.com/platforms</a></li>	
						<li>When you create an account for Trello, you have a Getting Started page to introduce you into Trello, and if you ever need 
						additional help you can either browse their <a href="https://trello.com/contact?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftrello.com%2F#/">documentation</a>, 
						or ask their <a href="https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Trello/ct-p/trello">Community</a> or 
						<a href="https://trello.com/contact?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftrello.com%2F#/">Trello Support</a></li>
					</ol>
					
					<li><h3><a href="http://www.stayfocusd.com/" class="h3">StayFocusd</a> (Extension)</h3></li>
					<ol>
						<li><a href="http://www.stayfocusd.com/">StayFocusd</a> is a website blocker that also keeps track of how much time you spend on 
						different websites. This allows you to see if you’ve been spending too much time lousing around instead of working. StayFocusd also 
						allows you to set a timer for each blocked websites, blocking these once you’ve used up all of your allotted time for these for 
						certain days you’ve chosen. Sadly, it’s only available for free on Google Chrome, and if you want to use something like it made by 
						the same developers you’ll have to use “Freedom”, which is paid for. It’s not incredibly intuitive though and so needs a bit of 
						exploration to grasp, but this pays off for the depth of its options.</li>
						<li>Features: Website Blocking, Time Spent Tracker, Top-up-able Time Allowance, Single Time Limit for all websites, and others.</li>
						<li>Requirements: Google Chrome</li>
						<li>Extension: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en">
						chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en</a></li>
						<li>If you have any questions about the extension, you can browse the Support tab in the Google Chrome Web store where the Developer 
						answers questions.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<li><h3><a href="https://blocksite.co/" class="h3">BlockSite</a> (Extension)</h3></li>
					<ol>
						<li><a href="https://blocksite.co/">BlockSite</a> is much like StayFocusd but is more intuitive and easy to use. You only have to put 
						a scheduled time and date (limited amount of different times without premium version), site urls, and turn it on to work! After this, 
						it will redirect you to either a custom link you set or its own redirect link to remind you to work. It also has a Pomodoro Setting 
						besides the scheduled time and date setting.</li>
						<li>Features: Website Blocking, Keyword blocking, Adult Content blocking, Single Time limit for all websites, Pomodoro Setting, etc.</li>
						<li>Requirements: Google Chrome</li>
						<li>Extension: <a href="https://blocksite.co/">blocksite.co/</li>
						<li>If you have any questions about the extension, you can browse the <a href="https://blocksite.co/support-requests/">Support Page</a> and 
						<a href="https://blocksite.co/faq/">FAQs Page</a></li>
					</ol>
					
					<li><h3><a href="https://momentumdash.com/" class="h3">Momentum</a> (Extension)</h3></li>
					<ol>
						<li>If you’d rather have a motivating kick to start your day instead of being forced out of websites, 
						<a href="https://momentumdash.com/">Momentum</a> might be the extension for you! It turns your New Tab into a motivational page with a 
						decent layout. Sadly, notes, due dates, and custom images are only available on Plus Mode.</li>
						<li>Features: Motivational New Tab, To-do list, Weather report, Mantras, Motivational Quotes, and much more.</li>
						<li>Requirements: Google Chrome</li>
						<li>Extension: <a href="https://momentumdash.com/">momentumdash.com/</a></li>
						<li>The Momentum website has its own <a href="https://get.momentumdash.help/hc/en-us">Help Center</a> where there are already a few 
						articles about <a href="https://get.momentumdash.help/hc/en-us/categories/115001272207-FAQs-Troubleshooting">FAQ’s</a> where you can also 
						search your questions</li>

				<h2> Break Management:</h2>
				<p>It can be hard to balance breaks and work most of the time, and this can lead to long periods of exhaustion. Productivity might be impacted 
				more than if proper breaks and work etiquette are observed. Sometimes, a simple timer and alarm clock might not be enough to pull you into a 
				break, so here’s a few resources I’ve gathered!</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li><h3><a href="https://breaktimer.app/" class="h3">Break Timer</a> (Application)</h3></li>
					<ol>
						<li><a href="https://breaktimer.app/">BreakTimer</a> is an open-source, free application for Windows, MacOS, and Linux users. It notifies 
						you to take a break during your set working hours during your work days after a certain period of time. However, if you take a break 
						before it notifies you to, it will automatically reset its break timer. You can postpone or skip a break if you need to by clicking its 
						notification just some time before you need to take a break.</li>
						<li>Features: Idle Reset Timer, Scheduled Breaks, Customizable actions to perform during break, Editable App Themes, and others.</li>
						<li>Requirements: Unknown</li>
						<li>Application: <a href="https://breaktimer.app/">breaktimer.app/</a></li>
						<li>The application is hosted on GitHub, and so you can find how other people got their problems resolved or send a question/report in 
						its <a href="https://github.com/tom-james-watson/breaktimer-app/issues">GitHub Issues Tab</a></li>
					</ol>
					
					<li><h3><a href="https://dejal.com/timeout/" class="h3">Time Out</a> (Application)</h3></li>
					<ol>
						<li><a href="https://dejal.com/timeout/">Time Out</a> is a MacOS application that makes you take a break every set interval of time. While 
						on break, the screen dims and a break theme appears. You can find out how much more time until the break ends by looking at a loading bar 
						at the bottom. You can skip the break if you need to, or even postpone it.</li>
						<li>Features: Customizable Break intervals, Customizable Breaks, Customizable actions to perform after break, Activity Tracker, Editable 
						Themes (using HTML, CSS, or JavaScript), and others.</li>
						<li>Requirements: MacOS 10.10 or later</li>
						<li>Application: <a href="https://dejal.com/timeout/">dejal.com/timeout/</a></li>
						<li>You can access the <a href="https://dejal.com/timeout/support/">Help Page</a> inside the App’s Help Menu, which you can then read in 
						your browser.</li>
