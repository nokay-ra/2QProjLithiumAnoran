		<p class="description">Welcome to Class Clash! It can sometimes feel hectic to be in the middle of this pandemic, and for us students it might be hard to adjust to our 
		current setup. Which is the reason for this website!</p>

			<p id="_top">Need some tips on how to survive class? Maybe you need some motivation to do your reqs? Or could you be searching for some apps 
			to help out in your journey? Well, don’t worry ‘cause this website has got you covered. You can also check out the references if you’re feeling 
			independent.</p>
			<h2 id="creator">About the Creator</h2>
			<p>Reuben Ryan Anoran is a 9th-grade student currently facing the pandemic when it comes to school, being unable to go out. He used to spend 
			most of his time in school at the library alone or at the field with his friends and classmates. Now, he currently spends most of his “free” 
			time on Messenger chatting with his friends and watching YouTube videos. </p>
			<h2 id="project">About the Project</h2>
			<p>Class Clash was made to help other students with coping and adjusting to our current setup of Remote-Learning, made by a student as well. 
			The website-title is based on how the setup feels for the Author; like a war. Some of the content is personally made by the author, while some 
			content is taken from mental-health research (sources can be found in the section with the same name).</p>
			<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
			<p>From the Navigation Bar, you already know that this website offers you Tips And Tricks, Productivity Tools, Motivation, and Sources, but 
			did you know that there are also secrets hidden around? Look around for things that might be out-of-place, these might be worth checking out. 
			Don’t forget to check the footnote for some awesome people I recommend you follow! If you want to reach out to me, the footnote also has all 
			the information you might need to get to me.</p>
